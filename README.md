Certainly! Here's the **English version** of a clear, well-structured `README.md` file for your project **[AI-Enterprise-Workflow-Capstone](https://github.com/Walid-Khalfa/AI-Enterprise-Workflow-Capstone)**:

```markdown
# AI Enterprise Workflow Capstone

> Final capstone project for the **IBM AI Enterprise Workflow** specialization

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project simulates a full AI workflow around a fictional business case (forecasting AAVAIL revenue), reflecting the three major components of the specialization:
1. **Data ingestion & exploration**
2. **Model development & evaluation**
3. **Deployment & monitoring**

## 🧪 Part 1: Data Exploration & Ingestion

- **Key steps**:
  - Understanding the business problem and formulating hypotheses
  - Identifying relevant data and justifying its use
  - Loading and cleaning via `src/ingest.py`
- **Deliverables**:
  - Notebooks in `nb/` (EDA, visualizations, feature analysis)
  - Automated data ingestion pipeline

---

## 📈 Part 2: Modeling & Evaluation

- **Models tested**: ARIMA/SARIMA, Random Forest, SVM, Gaussian Processes, etc.
- **Pipeline**:
  - Feature engineering (e.g. lag features, rolling windows)
  - Model training, validation, and selection
- **Outputs**:
  - Performance comparisons (see `nb/results.ipynb`)
  - Final model exported via `src/model.py`

---

## 🚀 Part 3: API, Deployment & Monitoring

- **API**:
  - Endpoints: `/predict`, `/train`, `/logs`, `/monitor`
  - Implemented in `src/api.py`, tested in `tests/`
- **Containerization**:
  - Docker image for deployment
- **CI & Testing**:
  - Pytest for unit testing across all components
- **Monitoring**:
  - Drift detection logic in `src/monitor.py` (e.g. Wasserstein distance)
  - Auto-generated model performance reports

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Install dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Walid-Khalfa/AI-Enterprise-Workflow-Capstone.git
cd AI-Enterprise-Workflow-Capstone
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Run the API locally

```bash
python run_app.py
```

### Or run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t ai-capstone .
docker run -p 8000:80 ai-capstone
```

### Example requests

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict?date=2025-07-01&duration=30"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict?date=2025-07-01&country=France"
```

### Run unit tests

```bash
python run_tests.py
```
